## What is the composite pattern?

The composite pattern is used to provide an implementation that allows the clients to treat an individual object (leaf) and a composition of objects (composite) the same.

The main components include (1) a common interface, (2) a leaf implementation, and (3) a composite implementation.

## What kind of problem is it solving?

The composite pattern is a structural design pattern. It is meant to be used when you are able to structure your program into a tree-like structure. This may help with simplifying a complex implementation of

## What is the solution?

## Conclusion

### When to use the composite pattern

The composite pattern is useful when...

- You need to represent part-whole hierarchies of objects
- You want clients to ignore differences between individual objects and composite objects
- The structure of your objects can vary and be built dynamically
- You need to apply operation recursively over structured components
